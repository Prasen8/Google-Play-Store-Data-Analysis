# Google-Play-Store-Data-Analysis

 📱 Google Play Store Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data from the Google Play Store to gain insights into app trends, user ratings, reviews, installs, and category performance.

 📊 Overview

The Google Play Store hosts millions of apps across various categories. Understanding the trends and insights behind these apps can help developers, marketers, and businesses make data-driven decisions. This project performs comprehensive data analysis on the Google Play Store dataset using Python, pandas, and powerful data visualization libraries.

 ✅ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw Play Store data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize trends in app categories, ratings, reviews, and installs.
- Identify patterns and correlations (e.g., between price, reviews, rating).
- Generate actionable insights using graphs and statistics.

 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - plotly (optional)
  - wordcloud (optional)
  - scikit-learn (for clustering or additional ML)

 📁 Dataset

The dataset is avilable on this Repository.

 🧹 Data Cleaning

The raw dataset contains inconsistencies and missing values. Data cleaning steps include:

- Handling null/missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Converting datatypes (e.g., `Installs`, `Price`, `Reviews`)
- Normalizing categorical values
- Filtering outliers

 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:
- Which category has the most apps?
- How do user ratings vary across categories?
- What is the distribution of app sizes and installs?
- Which apps have the most reviews and why?
- Are paid apps rated better than free apps?
- Which genres dominate the market?

 📈 Visualizations

The project includes various charts to illustrate the findings:

- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Histograms
- Box plots
- WordClouds (for app names and genres)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Category vs Rating plots

 📌 Key Insights

- Free apps dominate the Play Store, but paid apps tend to have slightly better ratings.
- Communication and Tools categories have high install counts.
- App ratings are generally skewed positively.
- Reviews and installs are strongly correlated.

 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Predicting app success using ML models.
- Clustering apps based on features.
- Building an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit.
